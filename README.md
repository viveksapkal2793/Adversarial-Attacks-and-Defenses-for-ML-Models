# Adversarial-Attacks-and-Defenses-for-ML-Models

Various Adversarial Attacks and Defenses were carried out and their impact was analysed on traditional ML Models.

- The dataset used was IAPRTC dataset. download the dataset from the following link and extract it in the root directory.

- Run task_0.ipynb to evaluate the ml models on the IAPRTC dataset.

- Run task_1.ipynb to perfrom adversarial attacks on the models and analyse their impact.

- Run task_2.ipynb to evaluate the models using various strategies for adversarial defense.

- More details about the adversarial attacks used and their impact and the adversarial defenses used and their impact is listed in reports.
